#### A websocket nodeJS bidding app for NSS MEAN stack Capstone
---
* This project is a full MEAN stack app made for the purpose of the backend Capstone for the Nashville Software School
* This application will allow bidders to compete with eachother for prized items (in this case old Apple products)
* The user must register and log in to start bidding. 
* The app will display the queue of items both "sold" and "for sale" and keep the individual users "won" items in a list

The motivation behind this app is eBay and SteepandCheap.com are some of my favorite websites.  Once I got into software development, I started to wonder how site such as these work.  My goal was to combine the two main functions of the websites and better understand how bidding apps work.
